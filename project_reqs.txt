Primary Requirements:
-----------------------

1. Artists can create a profile and upload their artwork, and this should have various privacy options that would allow some or all users to view them.

2a. Artists can pay a fee and allow their artwork to be displayed on priority basis for a fixed period of time. The time for which the artwork(s) would be viewable on priority basis would depend on the financial amount that the artist(s) have paid. 
2b. A selection of the artwork(s) displayed on priority basis would be viewable on the carousel widget. This would be a javascript based app that displays the artwork(s) automatically for a fixed period of time (let's say 3 seconds, though this should be changeable from the admin section.

3. Artists should be able to perform certain social networking activities from the application. For example, an artist should be able to post some artwork or a statistic (like number of "views" or "likes" of his/her artwork on the website) on social networking media such as Facebook or Instagram. (For a start, we would support Facebook, Instagram and Unsplash. We may support other sites as we go.)

4. The data (art images) displayed on the website would require a change of "imagepath" variable in every existing scraper. This should be done before the site goes public, so that the client(s) do not face any break in service.

5. The site should have space on top (leaderboard) and right side for advert placement. The dimensions for website adverts should be fixed prior to starting work.

6. Since this site would be viewable from mobile phone browsers, it should be responsive to screen dimensions. This should be implemented using MediaQueries.
